    Test Case: Ensuring an element is visible on screen by scrolling

    This test demonstrates how to scroll an element into view when it may be hidden 
    behind native or custom scrollbars.

    Scenario:
    1. Navigate to a page with scrollbars.
    2. Locate a button that may be out of view.
    3. Scroll the button into view.
    4. Optionally take a screenshot to verify the result.
    """

    # Step 1: Navigate to the scrollbars test page
    print("Navigating to the scrollbars test page...")
    page.goto("http://uitestingplayground.com/scrollbars")

    # Step 2: Locate the button that may be hidden
    btn = page.get_by_role("button", name="Hiding Button")

    # Step 3: Scroll the button into view
    print("Scrolling the button into view...")
    btn.scroll_into_view_if_needed()

    # Optional: Click the button (uncomment if needed)
    # print("Clicking the button...")
    # btn.click()

    # Step 4: Take a screenshot to confirm visibility
    print("Taking a screenshot of the page...")
    page.screenshot(path="test-scrollbars.jpg")
    print("Screenshot saved as 'test-scrollbars.jpg'.")


# Use Playwright to execute the test
with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    """
    Executes the test scenario for ensuring visibility of elements.
    """

    # Launch the Chromium browser with slow motion for better visualization
    print("Launching the browser...")
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False, slow_mo=3000)

    # Create a new browser context and page
    print("Creating a new browser context and page...")
    context = browser.new_context(ignore_https_errors=True, no_viewport=True)
    page = context.new_page()

    # Run the test case on the page
    print("Running the test case...")
    test_load_delay(page)

    # Close the browser after the test completes
    print("Closing the browser...")
    browser.close()

    print("Test execution completed.")

    Important Notes for Learning:
    - **Scroll Handling**: This example demonstrates how to ensure an element is visible 
      on screen by scrolling it into view.
    - **Visual Verification**: Taking a screenshot can help confirm the state of the UI 
      after actions are performed.
