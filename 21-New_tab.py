def handle_new_tab_demo():
    """
    This function demonstrates how to handle new tabs in Playwright.

    **Key Concepts Covered:**
    - **Opening a New Tab:** Learn how to trigger an action that opens a new tab.
    - **Switching Between Tabs:** Understand how to focus on different tabs during automation.

    **Example Use Case:**
    In web applications, clicking on certain links or buttons often opens new tabs. This function illustrates how to manage such scenarios effectively.

    **Steps Explained:**
    1. Launch the browser in non-headless mode and maximize the window.
    2. Open a specified webpage that contains a button to open a new tab.
    3. Click the button to open the new tab and switch focus between the original and new tabs.

# Interview Questions:
"""
1. What is the purpose of using `expect_page()` in Playwright?
   Answer: `expect_page()` is used to wait for a new page (or tab) to open after an action, allowing us to capture the new page reference immediately.

2. How do you switch between tabs in Playwright?
   Answer: You can switch between tabs by using the `bring_to_front()` method on the `Page` object corresponding to the tab you want to focus on.

3. What happens if you try to interact with a tab that has not fully loaded?
   Answer: If you attempt to interact with a tab that hasn't fully loaded, it may lead to errors or unexpected behavior. It's essential to use `wait_for_load_state()` to ensure the page is ready for interaction.

# Explanation of Key Lines:
"""
1. with context.expect_page() as new_page_info:
   - Purpose: This line sets up a context manager that waits for a new page (or tab) to be opened as a result of the action that follows it. In Playwright, this is a convenient way to handle scenarios where an action (like clicking a button) results in the opening of a new tab.
   - Context Manager: The with statement ensures that the code block inside it is executed while monitoring for the event of a new page opening. If a new page opens during the execution of this block, the context manager captures that page.
   - new_page_info: This variable holds information about the newly opened page. It is an object that contains various properties and methods to interact with the new page once it has been created.

2. new_page = new_page_info.value
   - Accessing the New Page: After the click action, if a new page is opened, new_page_info.value will contain a reference to that new page object. This allows you to interact with the new page in subsequent lines of your code.
   - Storing the Reference: By assigning new_page_info.value to the variable new_page, you can now use this variable to call methods on the new page, such as checking its URL, clicking elements, or retrieving data.

3. new_page.wait_for_load_state()
   - Waiting for Load Completion: This method is called on the newly opened page object to ensure that the page has fully loaded before you try to interact with it.
   - Load States: Playwright defines different load states (like load, domcontentloaded, networkidle, etc.). By using wait_for_load_state(), you can specify which load state you want to wait for, ensuring that all necessary resources are loaded and the page is ready for interactions.
   - Importance: Waiting for the page to load is crucial because attempting to interact with elements that havenâ€™t been fully loaded yet can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
