#     """
#     Takes a screenshot of a specific element on a webpage.

#     This function navigates to the given URL and captures a screenshot
#     of the <h1> element. When you take a screenshot of an element using
#     Playwright, it captures only the visible portion of that specific
#     element, including any styling applied to it (like borders or shadows).
#     The screenshot will not include anything outside of that element,
#     such as surrounding elements, text, or the overall webpage layout.

#     Key Points:
#     -----------
#     - Element Boundaries: Only the area defined by the elementâ€™s dimensions will be captured.
#     - Visibility: If part of the element is hidden (e.g., due to scrolling),
#       only the visible part will be included in the screenshot.
#     - Element Type: Regardless of whether the element is a div, image, or
#       any other type, the screenshot will reflect the specific area occupied
#       by that element.

#     Notes:
#     ------
#     - The screenshot is saved as 'element_screenshot.png'.

# =================
# In Playwright, the omit_background parameter in the page.screenshot() method specifies whether to capture the screenshot without the background color of the page. Here's a breakdown:

# omit_background=True: The screenshot will be taken with a transparent background. This is useful when you want to overlay the screenshot on a different background or if the background color of the page is not needed.

# omit_background=False: The screenshot will include the background color of the page as it appears in the browser. This is the default behavior.

# Using omit_background=True can be particularly beneficial when you're capturing UI components that you plan to use in different contexts or background
# page.screenshot(path="screenshot.jpg", type="jpeg")
# type: You can specify either 'png' or 'jpeg'. If the type is not provided, Playwright defaults to png.
