    Verify Button Visibility After Clicking 'Hide' Button

    Scenario:
    A web application may alter the visibility of elements in various ways: removing elements from the DOM,
    adjusting their size, hiding them via styles (opacity, visibility), or moving them offscreen. 

    In this test, we:
    1. Navigate to the 'Visibility' page.
    2. Click the 'Hide' button.
    3. Verify the visibility or CSS properties of other buttons, which are hidden or manipulated in different ways.

    The goal is to learn how to check the visibility of DOM elements using Playwright's `expect` API.

    Buttons checked:
    - Removed
    - Zero Width
    - Overlapped
    - Opacity 0
    - Visibility Hidden
    - Display None
    - Offscreen

    Important Notes for Learning:
    - **Element Visibility**: This example shows how to check different types of visibility (hidden, zero width, opacity, etc.).
    - **Error Handling**: An example of handling a `TimeoutError` for when an element is not interactable due to being overlapped.
    - **Assertions**: Using Playwrightâ€™s `expect` API to check for hidden elements and CSS properties.
